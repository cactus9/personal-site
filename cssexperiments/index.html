            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> (CSS) is a programming language developed in the mid-90s with the goal of styling web pages, currently maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">World Wide Web Consortium's</a> <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css">CSS Working Group</a>.<br><br>For the first decade or so of the language's existence its scope and mission-statement were fairly straightforward: web pages are made up of images, paragraphs, videos, etc. that need to be positioned and sized accordingly. In 2007 however, Apple's representatives in the Working Group put forward a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Mar/0313.html">wishlist</a> of features that the company wanted to see incoporated into the language. These included 3 incredibly powerful tools for creating design-complex pages (all of which incidentally are used on this site's homepage):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>2D and 3D transformations</b> - translations, rotations, skews performed in either 2 or 3 dimensions</li>
                <li><b>Animations and transitions</b> - event-triggered or "ambient" animations, e.g. the fill effect I use on links. Can include transformations, allowing for dynamic 3D effects</li>
                <li><b>Filter effects</b> - blurring and hue-shifting images, drop-shadows, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I only found out that 3D animations were possible in CSS about 6 months ago, and my initial reactions to this revelation were</p>
            <ol>
                <li>"Wow! That's really cool."</li>
                <li>"Wait, then what's the point of &ltcanvas&gt?"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These features are neat and all, but this wasn't even new to the web when this was first proposed - it's that this used to be primarily handled by JavaScript libraries. Additionally, when I've shown people the demos I've made using pure CSS, their reaction always carries a feeling of "CSS? <i>Really?</i>" - a slight bafflement, a sense that putting this functionality in CSS is somehow unintuitive. Anyone familiar with the language will know that "intuitive" has never been an accurate descriptor for any aspect of CSS, but still. <br><br>The reason why these features are in the language is simple: Apple asked for them, and a lot of the group thought they were nifty. There was also some <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Mar/0322.html">discussion</a> on CSS not wanting to become irrelevant as other technologies began to fulfill demands for presenting web content. As for why Apple specifically was the one to call for these, it's hard to tell. As an aside, I recommend reading one Apple representative's hilariously shady and unprofessional <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Mar/0321.html">response</a> to a Microsoft employee questioning if these features were really appropriate. It brought me joy.<br><br>Appropriate or not, in this article I want to explore not only what you can do with these features, but also have a closer look at what the designs of their implementations ended up being.</p>
            <h3>CSS crash course</h3>
            <p>As some of you reading this may not have worked with CSS before or perhaps need a refresher, here's a brief run-down of how CSS works. On a basic level, CSS documents are a list of rules that take the following structure:</p>
            <pre class="code">
selector {
    property: value;
    other-property: other-value;
    ...
}</pre>
            <p>Where <code>selector</code> is some string specifying which parts of a web page to apply that styling rule to. For a concrete example of these in action, the following is the code for a page with a single paragraph colored red (CSS being put in the &ltstyle&gt section):</p>
            <pre class="code">
&lthtml&gt
    &lthead&gt
        &ltstyle&gt
            p {
                color:red;
            }
        &lt/style&gt
    &lt/head&gt
    &ltbody&gt
        &ltp&gtThis is a paragraph.&lt/p&gt
    &lt/body&gt
&lt/html&gt</pre>
            <div class="frame" style="border:1px solid black">
                <p style="color:red">This is a paragraph.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Animations and transitions</h2>
            <p>Often when styling web pages, you want to be able to change the presentation of content depending on how the user interacts with it. For example, when the user hovers over a button you might want it to glow slightly, or perhaps when they click on an image you might want it to smoothly move to the center of the screen and expand. <i>Transitions</i> in CSS allow us to define exactly those kinds of changes in styling.</p>
            <pre class="code">
button {
    border: 1px solid black;
    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
button:hover {
    filter: drop-shadow(0em 0em 0.5em lightblue);
    border-color: blue;
}</pre>
            <button type="button">Hover to glow!</button>
            <p>In order to create the above, I have defined two rules - one is applied to the button in its "default" mode, the other applies to the button only when it is hovered over by the user. When the button is hovered over, the first rule defines the start of the transition and the second the end goal. With the <code>transition</code> keyword, I define which properties are included in my transition ("all" for convenience), how long I want the whole transition to take, and a <i>timing function</i> that helps me control the feel of the final result. Compare the above with changing the timing function to <code>linear</code>:</p>
            <button type="button" style="transition-timing-function: linear">Linear timing</button>
            <p>The difference is subtle, but the eased function has a bounce to it that is missing in the linear one; the linear function feels sluggish in comparison.<br><br>Transitions define how content moves from a default styling to some other styling due to some interaction with the user - an explicit trigger. An <i>animation</i> is very similar, except it is not triggered by something the user does - it just happens on its own. Because we aren't looking at triggers like hovering or clicking to define endpoints for the animation, we'll instead write keyframes for it. For example, let's take the glowing button from earlier and make it pulse eerily in the background while the user is not hovering over it.</p>
<pre class="code">
.pulsebutton {
    animation: pulse 0.75s alternate infinite;
}
@keyframes pulse {
    to {
        color: blue;
        border-color: blue;
    }
}
</pre>
            <button type="button" class="pulsebutton">pulse pulse pulse</button>
            <p>In the above rule for the <code>pulsebutton</code> class, we are saying that we will play the <code>pulse</code> animation back-and-forth forever, with each forward pass and each backward pass taking 0.75 seconds. The <code>to</code> keyword signals the rules for the end state of the animation, but I could also have used percentages if I wanted some rules to only apply halfway through.<br><br> In terms of the designs of these features, I actually really like them. The examples I've shown have been simple, but I think it's not too hard to see how you could build these up to create a truly dynamic and impressive design for a website. It's far from perfect, of course. Having to remember what order keywords go in for the <code>animation</code> rule is always a pain, I'm disappointed that you can't define transitions through the powerful keyframes syntax, and trying to transition already-animated features of an element just doesn't work right. Overall though, solid 8/10.</p>
