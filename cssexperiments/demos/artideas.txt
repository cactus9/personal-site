Things to make in CSS

Biblically correct angel
- moving rings
- wings of something cool?
- glowing eye - some fun drop-shadow possible here
- ooo maybe we fucks with the blending modes tho

fox
- so the fox animation casts a shadow on the wall, revealing text
    - what's the text?
    - I could write a poem or a stream-of-consciousness
- need to model a lamp or a torch or something
- Might be cool to have a glow effect from the torch - using the counter-spin technique to make it circular might be a nice way to go about that

Waves? PLaying with text and the deep

MOdelling more complex iris petals - maybe building up to a bouquet
Pagoda?
